.. _`Getting started guide`: manual_101_root.html

Important
==========
First time users are strongly advised to read the `Getting started guide`_  which explains how to properly configure PyDev


Release 2.7.0
===============


* **Code formatter**:

 * Number of spaces before a comment can be configured (default: 2 spaces as pep-8 recommends)
 * Minimum number of spaces before start of comment may be configured (default: 1 space as pep-8 recommends)
 * Right trim lines now also properly trims comments.
 * When the auto-formatter is enabled, if syntax errors are present the code-formatting is not applied (it could end up getting things wrong in this situation).

* Python 3.3 'yield from' syntax now properly supported.

* Fixed issue when unable to get filesystem encoding when configuring interpreter.
* Debugger: 'Enable Condition' checkbox in break properties dialog no longer ignored.
* Fixed ClassCastException during parse in Python file with yield in global scope.
* Fixed StackOverflowError in fast parser (i.e.: parser used to get only the outline of the code).
* PyDev Mylyn integration can now be installed on Eclipse 4.2.
* Fixed NPE when trying to add interpreter and it detected directory which we could not list() in Java.
* Fixed cache issue in code-completion (nature.startRequests() could end up not having nature.endRequests() called).
* Save a bit faster on big files (i.e.: No longer doing invalidateTextPresentation on each save).


Release 2.6.0
===============

* **Interactive console**:

 * **It's now possible to use the interactive console attached to a debug session.** (patch from Hussain Bohra)
 
   * To use this feature either right-click a frame in the debug view and choosing PyDev > Debug console or create a new Interactive console as usual (Ctrl+Alt+Enter and choose 'PyDev Debug Console' -- but note that this option will only be enabled when in a debug session with a selected frame in the Debug view.
   
 * Fixed issue where completions from the console did not work properly with '%' because quoting was not being properly done.
 * Fixed issue where the **execfile()** redefinition in the PyDev console did not use the proper globals
 * When launching interactive console, PYTHONPATH order is properly kept (patch from James Blackburn).
 * Fix pasting into the middle of the console (patch from James Blackburn).
 * For paste, only go to the end of the line if the cursor isn't in range (patch from James Blackburn).

* **PyUnit**:
 
 * Improved preferences page configuration (links shown to add options).
 * Improved test discovery in PyDev PyUnit runner (exclude/include files/tests options added).
  
* **Jython**:

 * **print** may be used in dotted names as Jython requires for grammars 2.4 and 2.5.
 

* **Others**:

 * In a build, PyDev could end up reading the contents of files unrelated to Python.
 * Django project startup compatible with django 1.4.
 * Assignments to builtins when in the class-level no longer generate a warning.
 * Fixed issue starting new thread in the debugger (fix for **paste/waitress**).
 * Fixed error configuring interpreter if os.path was not present.
 * Fixed issue when configuring interpreter which has unicode characters in the PYTHONPATH.
 * When searching for external files, also take a look at the configured projects, as it may be that the file should actually be found in an external source folder.
 * Fixed issues getting marker on files with a dirty editor and where we could end up getting markers from other files.
 * The scripting output console is not shown unless there's actually some output to show.
 * A bunch of other minor fixes.
